      "For the first steps, see an internist who will conduct a medical interview with you and order the necessary tests. Remember that diagnosis is always done by a doctor, do not diagnose yourself. Once you know that you have irritable bowel syndrome, then try to build a team of trusted specialists, including a doctor, nutritionist, trainer and psychologist.",

      "What supplements support the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome?",
    "Faq.answer-3":
      "In the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, apart from medications selected by the attending physician, individually planned supplementation is also used. Ask your dietitian to help you with this. Supplements that might be helpful are: peppermint, water-soluble fiber, sodium butyrate or probiotics.

    "Faq.question-4": "Which diet to choose for irritable bowel syndrome?",
