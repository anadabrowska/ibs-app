    "Faq.question-1":
      "Where to go for help if you think you have irritable bowel syndrome?",
    "Faq.answer-1":
      "For the first steps, see an internist who will conduct a medical interview with you and order the necessary tests. Remember that diagnosis is always done by a doctor, do not diagnose yourself. Once you know that you have irritable bowel syndrome, then try to build a team of trusted specialists, including a doctor, nutritionist, trainer and psychologist.",
    "Faq.question-2": "How to recognize irritable bowel syndrome?",
    "Faq.answer-2":
      "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome can only be made by a doctor after taking an interview and conducting a series of tests. IBS is a chronic disease and is diagnosed when abdominal pain occurs for at least one day a week for the last three months. It is usually accompanied by pain related to bowel movements and a change in the frequency and consistency of bowel movements.",
    "Faq.question-3":
      "What supplements support the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome?",
    "Faq.answer-3":
      "In the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, apart from medications selected by the attending physician, individually planned supplementation is also used. Ask your dietitian to help you with this. Supplements that might be helpful are: peppermint, water-soluble fiber, sodium butyrate or probiotics. Consider also psychotherapy, it is not a supplement, but studies have shown that it is highly effective in relieving IBS symptoms.",
    "Faq.question-4": "Which diet to choose for irritable bowel syndrome?",
    "Faq.answer-4":
      "There is no one-size-fits-all diet for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Each person should create their own individual list of well-tolerated products. This is what Experiments in the IBS-Monitor are for. Currently, the low FODMAP diet is considered the most effective diet in IBS. ",

This can mitigate most symptoms and significantly improve the quality of their lives.",
    "AboutUs.what-we-stand-for-pt2":
      "Our mission is to create an application in which people with IBS will have all the knowledge relevant to the course of the disease, always at hand.

We also want IBSMonitor to be a safe and friendly space for everyone.",
